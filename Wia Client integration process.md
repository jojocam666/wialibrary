I- BLOCKCHAIN/
Wia is a new disruptive form of blockchain which is manipulated by the nodes of the network but is authenticated by a "distributed node" technology, which is in fact a mini-software which ensures several trust missions not yet truly resolved by the blockchain community at present , such as block validation and transaction authentication, thus requiring no mining activity on the network, which makes our blockchain an autonomous network, which in the future would prove to be very efficient in terms of electrical energy saving and faster and more reliable.
